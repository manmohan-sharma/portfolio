## About

This site represents my professional work and thinking across:

- Technology Architecture & Technical Program Management
- Reliability, Performance & Scale
- Cloud-native and distributed systems
- AI-enabled quality and decision systems
- Cross-functional program leadership

It is designed to evolve from a **personal portfolio** into a broader **systems / AI / platform brand** over time.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** Material UI (MUI)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules / MUI theming
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (Google Cloud)
- **Build Type:** Static export (`next build` → `out/`)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
Run locally
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000

Production Build
This project is deployed as a static site.

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This generates an out/ directory used by Firebase Hosting.

Deployment
Hosting is handled via Firebase Hosting (Google Cloud).

bash
Copy code
firebase deploy --only hosting
Auto-deployment can be enabled via GitHub Actions.

Design Principles
Clarity over complexity

Systems thinking over feature count

Reliability and predictability

Future-ready architecture

Roadmap (High-Level)
 Content expansion (case studies, systems thinking)

 Performance & reliability write-ups

 AI / agent systems experimentation

 Custom domain expansion (.ai, .systems)

### What this README does well
- Recruiter-friendly (clear purpose, tech, link)
- Founder-ready (brand story + roadmap)
- Scales beyond a portfolio
- Neutral, global, serious tone
- GitHub-standard formatting

If you want, next I can:
- tailor a **shorter README** (startup-style)
- add **badges** (build, deploy, tech)
- rewrite this as a **company-facing README** later

Just tell me 👍

# Pramana

> Building reliable systems. Delivering predictable outcomes.

**Pramana** is my personal portfolio and technical showcase, focused on **systems thinking, reliability, and scalable engineering**.  
The name *Pramāṇa* comes from Indian philosophy and means *valid knowledge, proof, and correct reasoning* — a principle that strongly aligns with modern AI, system design, and trustworthy software.
